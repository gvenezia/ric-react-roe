# Ric-React-Roe
A program that uses the basic principles of React to create a single-page web app.

### How was it built?
I follow [the official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to create this project.

While React apps requires configuration of tools like Babel and Webpack, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)â€”which preconfigures the necessary tools.

Here is the most recent version of the [create-react-app guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
